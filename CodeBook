THE DATA
Data set comes from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip and represents data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone by UCI

TRANSFORMATIONS
1. bound train and test datasets and extracted mean/standard deviation
2. Added subject and activity names where appropriate and modified select variable names
3. Aggregated all data into one file
